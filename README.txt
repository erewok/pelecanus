A Python3 application for navigating and editing nested JSON objects. For more 
information, please see documentation/github.


Name
----
Named 'pelecanus' after Pelecanus occidentalis, the
brown Pelican of California and the Eastern Pacific:

which is a wonderful bird and which deserves to have something
named after it and because I got tired of writing "NestedJson".
