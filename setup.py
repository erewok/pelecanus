Pelecanus
=========

A Python3 application for navigating and editing nested JSON objects. For more
information, please see README.md (on github).


Name
----
Named 'pelecanus' after Pelecanus occidentalis, the
brown Pelican of California and the Eastern Pacific:

http://www.nps.gov/chis/naturescience/brown-pelican.htm

which is a wonderful bird and which deserves to have something
named after it and because I got tired of writing "NestedJson".

More Info

See github project or docs for more detailed usage instructions.
