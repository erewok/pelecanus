The prototype for the BrainWave desktop microwave is the answer. It's exactly what it sounds like: a phone book-size microwave to heat up your frozen lunch, at your desk.</p><p>The BrainWave is controlled through a computer program and connects through a USB port, and if you have a specially packaged meal, an RFID-tagged plastic spoon will let you scan the box and send the meal information to the microwave. This will automatically set the heating time. Oh, and the BrainWave can be stored in an upright position, so it can function as a whiteboard when not zapping Lean Cuisines.</p><p>Like we mentioned, <a href=\"https://www.behance.net/gallery/Desktop-Microwave-Oven/499521\">this is only a prototype</a> that U.K.-based designer Steve Gates came up with in order to graduate, a few years before Kickstarter. So we were curious what happened with the BrainWave and whether it still might become a reality.</p><p>\"It would have taken a large investment to have these parts custom produced at a smaller size, which wasn't feasible or economical at the time,\" Gates told NPR, by email. But he hasn't lost hope. \"I've had a lot of interest in the product and should the right circumstances arise, yes I would certainly consider [manufacturing] this.\"</p><p>If it does get widely made, it would be the perfect gift for anyone in your life who enjoys sodium-packed meals without any physical exertion. [Read: me.]</p><p>And Gates is still coming up with more enhancements. He says he can imagine a portable version of the BrainWave, too. \"Just imagine warming up your toasted sandwich on the tube or bus on your way to work.

Scientists now say warming is scrambling the complex relationship between water and nature and could threaten some species with extinction as well as bring hardship to ranchers and farmers already suffering from prolonged drought.</p><p>To see how this vast natural irrigation system works, it's best to fly over it. Seated next to <a href=\"http://flbs.umt.edu/people/Hauer~183/default.aspx?ID=183\">Richard Hauer</a> in a Cessna he calls \"Montana Rose,\" I can see snowcapped mountains and wide valleys spread out below. Hauer, an ecologist at the University of Montana, calls this place a giant sponge.</p><p>Moist air from the Pacific hits the mountains and falls as snow and ice. The mountains hold that water until spring. Then it melts and runs through the gravel valleys and across big parts of North America.</p><p>It's worked that way for millennia. But lately, Hauer says, Montana is warmer, and spring's melt starts earlier. \"When that happens, all that storage of snow and water in the high country will go through the system [the mountains and valleys] much faster,\" he explains. \"It's a change that's taking place because the snowmelt is occurring earlier. ... Basically, if you turn the spigot on earlier, it runs out of water sooner.\"</p><p>Running out of water sooner means drier summers \u2014 just when plants, animals and people need it most.</p><p>Ecologists like Hauer say there are other changes happening as well \u2014 retreating glaciers, and more flash floods. \"One of the expectations with climate change is that we're going to see a decrease in the permanent streams, particularly in the high alpine, and an increase in the temporary, ephemeral streams,\" Hauer says.</p><p>Already, scientists have noted the shrinking of the more than two dozen glaciers in Glacier National Park, as well as the disappearance of some snowfields that once lasted through summer.</p><p>Now they're trying to find out how this affects wildlife \u2014 wildlife that's important for holding together the complex food web here.</p><p>I join three scientists from the U.S. Geological Survey on a mountainside a couple of thousand feet below Hauer's flight path. We're hiking up into a snowfield in the park, toward a stream flowing down from the snow. \"It's a great place to be if you are an obscure, high-alpine-stream insect,\" says aquatic entomologist <a href=\"http://www.nrmsc.usgs.gov/staff/giersch\">Joe Giersch</a>. Obscure insects are Giersch's life. Several species of very rare but important insects live here, in 40-degree meltwater.</p><p>Giersch bends over the stream \u2014 it's only a few inches deep \u2014 and turns over a few rocks. In 10 minutes, he finds what he wants: a tiny, brown, wet smudge of a fly. \"All right! This is <em>Lednia tumana</em>.\" It's smaller than the head of a match and, to my eye, is just a <a href=\"http://www.nrmsc.usgs.gov/research/lednia\">brown blob</a>. Giersch assures me that's what it is. \"I've looked at a lot of these,\" he says. He calls the fly \"charismatic microfauna.\"</p><p>Charismatic may be a stretch, but micro for sure. <em>Lednia tumana</em> is a <a href=\"http://www.ecospark.ca/changingcurrents/stonefly\">stonefly</a>. It spends part of its life in streams, but only icy streams in these mountains. It eats algae and other tiny organisms in the streams, and other insects and fish eat it. Stoneflies are part of a larger food web. Pull out one string, says our hiking companion, <a href=\"http://www.nrmsc.usgs.gov/staff/fagre.html\">Daniel Fagre</a>, and the web starts to come apart.</p><p>\"In only a few decades, we're going to lose all the glaciers here,\" says Fagre, a research ecologist with the USGS at the West Glacier Field Station. \"And they've been persistent on the landscape here for 7,000 years \u2014 so suddenly you are having a profound change in just a few decades, and that's very difficult for many organisms to adapt to.\"</p><p>What's happening is that as the average temperature increases here, the snow and ice, in effect, retreat up the mountain to colder air. Ecologist <a href=\"http://nrmsc.usgs.gov/staff/muhlfeld\">Clint Muhlfeld</a>, who also <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/2014/05/27/316316952/hybrid-trout-threaten-montanas-native-cutthroats\">studies this fly</a>, says eventually the ice and the insects will run out of mountain. \"You know, there's nowhere to go,\" he says. \"They're at the top of the continent \u2014 the water tower of the continent \u2014 and it's a squeeze play.\" Muhlfeld notes that the federal government is considering listing <em>Lednia</em> as an endangered species because of the effects of climate change.</p><p>Moving farther down the mountain, you can see more signs of this disruption in the way water works here \u2014 in places like Montana's Flathead Lake, for example, one of the biggest lakes in the country.</p><p><a href=\"http://flbs.umt.edu/people/Stanford~1296/\">Jack Stanford</a>, who runs the Flathead Lake Biological Station, has spent decades studying the complex interactions of plants, animals and water. \"The way in which water is deposited first and then transported by the rivers is fundamental to the distribution and abundance of organisms,\" he says.</p><p>Some of those organisms \u2014 for instance, salmon \u2014 are important, not only to nature but to people too.</p><p>If you get a warmer spring, you get flash floods, because the rain comes in before the snow has melted. It's called a \"rain on snow event,\" and it can be trouble for salmon, which lay eggs in the gravel of stream beds. Rain on snow is like rain falling on pavement \u2014 it creates floods that wash the young salmon away, decimating the population.</p><p>\"The way it plays out is that the food web gets a shakeup,\" Stanford says. \"And ... the bottom line is, some players in that complex food web will be winners, and some will be losers.\"</p><p>Stanford says humans have already changed the natural world in ways we couldn't predict. Climate change is like putting another pair of dice in play.  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2014 NPR.

It is such a powerful force that it may even outsell Coca-Cola here \u2014 making it one of the few places on the globe where Coke isn't the leading brand.</p><p>\"This stuff runs in my blood,\" says Chris Young, as he walks through downtown Glasgow carrying a bottle.</p><p>Perhaps he's not a fair sample, though, since he is actually drinking the stuff. The woman with him, Gayle Fergus, has no such bottle. So is she as devoted a fan?</p><p>\"Probably more,\" she says.</p><p>This seems impossible, given that her buddy claims the soda courses through his veins. But she insists.</p><p>\"I've got the pens, I've got the merchandise as well.\" Fergus even speaks longingly of Irn Bru kilts, in bright orange and blue.</p><p>These people are not outliers. Even the first person we stop at random on a Glasgow street professes a seemingly unnatural passion for the brew.</p><p>\"For my wedding toast, I had Irn Bru in champagne glasses instead of champagne,\" says Laura Calgie.</p><p>For the sake of journalistic integrity, it's important to confirm that she has no family connection to the company. She insists she does not, then pauses.</p><p>\"I was brought up about 10 minutes away from the factory, so maybe they put something in the water,\" she says.</p><p>As Scots prepare to vote on independence next month, the fizzy fervor for this fluorescent fluid may offer some insights into Scottish nationalistic tendencies. When asked why they're so crazy for this Scottish soda, people most often reply, \"Because it's Scottish.\"</p><p>\"We're proud of what we have. That's why it outsells Coca-Cola,\" says Fergus. \"Because we're so proud of our own products.\"</p><p>At a nearby old-fashioned candy store, shop worker Agnes Plunkett has shelves of Irn Bru-flavored sweets, from sticky taffy to translucent lollipops. Though since these are not officially licensed products, they're spelled \"Iron Brew.\"</p><p>\"This is the chews. This is Iron Brew humbugs. Orange flavored as well, orange colored,\" she says, walking down the shelf of candies. Every thing Iron Brew flavored is a great seller, she says. \"Very popular.\"</p><p>Plunkett lets a visitor sample one of the hard candies. It starts out sweet, followed by a burst of acidity. And, of course, it's bright orange.</p><p>Much of the world treats Scottish icons as kitsch. Kilts. Haggis. Bagpipes. But for Scots, these are potent symbols of national pride. One of Irn Bru's advertising slogans is \"Made in Scotland, from girders.\" Girders, as in the steel beams that hold up buildings.</p><p>\"People call Irn Bru Scotland's other national drink, after whisky,\" says Sara Grady of the market research firm Datamonitor Consumer. \"Whereas I think Coke prides itself on being a brand that's the same all over the world, Irn Bru appeals to people because it's so Scottish.\"</p><p>Grady explains that she's English, \"and so everything I see of English culture, we're kind of shy about it. Whereas they're just loud and proud.\"</p><p>\"In some ways, I guess you could say that while Coca-Cola embodies the American dream, Irn Bru could be the Scottish version of that,\" she says.</p><p>At the Irn Bru factory just outside Glasgow, visitors must wear protective earphones. The rattling sound is constant as 96,000 cans an hour fly down the line.</p><p>\"We'll sell about the equivalent of 17 cans a second, which is a huge volume to keep up with,\" says brand manager Martin Steele, who's serving as our tour guide.</p><p>When the tour is done, I tell Steele that I have a confession.</p><p>I still have not actually tasted Irn Bru soda.</p><p>\"Shall we do that? Shall I get you a can and you can try it?\" he says. \"Give me two seconds. I'll nip into the factory and get you a can.\"</p><p>He brings back an ice-cold bottle, straight off the factory floor. The contents are the color of a sunset in a hazy sky.</p><p>I take a sip. And it tastes like ... soda. Sweet. Fizzy. A bit bubble-gummy.</p><p>To me, it seems like nothing special. Then again, I'm not Scottish.  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2014 NPR.

The Assyrian Christian villagers had opened their schools and homes to Iraqis fleeing the takeover of nearby Mosul by Islamist fighters calling themselves the Islamic State.</p><p>But these days, most of Al-Qoush is as silent as the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabban_Hormizd_Monastery\" target=\"_blank\">6th-century monastery </a>overlooking the village from a hill. A few Kurdish security men guard the entrance to the village, primarily concerned with keeping potential looters away from the tidy stone and cement homes.</p><p>The villagers fled en masse in early August, when Islamist fighters made a move in Al-Qoush's direction. Now, as Kurdish forces begin to retake territory around Mosul, including the strategic Mosul dam, some families have begun to trickle back to Al-Qoush. Most stay only during daylight hours, however, afraid to stay overnight with Islamic State forces a mere 20 miles away.</p><p><strong>Leaving Everything Behind, Yet Again</strong></p><p>Raed Salman, 45, is one of the few who's here full time, at least for now. The truck driver's recent history is sadly familiar to many Iraqis.</p><p>\"This is the second time I'm displaced. We're originally from Baghdad,\" he says. \"We fled Baghdad; my father and brother were kidnapped. We paid a huge ransom, but they shot and badly wounded my brother. Now we're displaced for a second time.\"</p><p>Salman gestures to his large, well-appointed home. He says it took years of high-risk travel on Iraq's deadly highways to save enough money to finish it. But he's resigned to leaving it all behind, once again, because his family's safety comes first.</p><p>\"Believe me, there is nowhere in Iraq that is safe for us,\" he says. \"We have Shiite friends in the city of Kut. They say, 'Come live with us. We'll keep you safe.' They're good friends, but what about the future? They could be the next ones displaced.\"</p><p>Salman doesn't know where they'll go. Their passports are expired, and he doesn't think there's much chance of renewing them now.</p><p><strong>New Pressure On A Dwindling Population</strong></p><p>A deep current of fear is once again running through Iraq's Christian minority, which has roots in the earliest days of the faith. Precise counts are impossible to come by, but Christians are believed to have numbered about 1.5 million when the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq began in 2003. Current estimates range from 200,000 to 400,000.</p><p>While the Christian exodus from Iraq is extreme and driven by the country's bloodshed, it's a trend that's been underway for decades throughout the Middle East. In the mid-20th century, Christians were estimated to be about 20 percent of the Middle East's population. <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/blogs/parallels/2014/05/21/314270024/the-1-000-year-old-schism-that-pope-francis-seeks-to-heal\">Today, it's 5 percent at most</a>.</p><p>In June, NPR spoke with Rinam Mansour, 30, a teacher who was volunteering to help displaced people from Mosul. Now he sits on his couch, pondering his own future.</p><p>\"I was on the church's commission to help displaced people,\" he says. \"They were Shiites, Christians and others. We opened our doors and gave them what we could. And now, we ourselves are the displaced.\"</p><p>In numerous interviews with displaced Yazidis, another religious minority in Iraq, many said they envied the Christians because at least they had a church establishment to stand up for them. Mansour laughs bitterly when he hears this.</p><p>\"The church protect us? The church people were the first ones to leave,\" he says. \"Maybe Al-Qoush used to be a strong Christian village, but now most people want to leave Iraq. I think only those families with no money, no passports, no friends to help them relocate, will stay.\"</p><p>Mansour's sister Lillian has already tried relocating. The United Nations moved her family to Southern California after the last round of anti-Christian violence in 2008. She says because the U.S. was in recession at the time, there were no jobs to be had, so after exhausting all of their options, they decided to return to northern Iraq.</p><p>\"When we got back, it took my husband over a year to find work, and then at least things were better than in America,\" she says. \"But just a few months later, all this started.\"</p><p>As luck would have it, Lillian's husband found work as a teacher in one of the minority villages around Mount Sinjar just before it was terrorized by Islamic State fighters.</p><p>For Rinam Mansour, the future looks bleak. He says the best-case scenario is to give up his home and the relative prestige of teaching, and hope he can land a menial job in a strange country. He believes that if Iraqi Christians are to survive, it won't be in Iraq.  <div class=\"fullattribution\">Copyright 2014 NPR.
